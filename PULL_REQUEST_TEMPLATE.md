### Before you submit this, make sure you have:

 - [ ] Ran format.py to ensure code is formatted
 - [ ] Written tests if you added new features to WPILib
 - [ ] Modified tests if you changed behavior
 - [ ] Made corresponding changes in *both* Java and C++
 - [ ] Made corresponding changes in simulation (again, Java and C++)

### Things that will make it less likely for your PR (Pull Request) to be accepted:

 - [ ] Breaking API. This means changing function names or public variable names.
 - [ ] Combining stylistic changes with functional changes. Break it into two smaller PRs.
 - [ ] Large PRs. If you change 500 lines, it's going to take more work to review.
       Keep your PRs small and easy to read.
 - [ ] Unessecary changes. They distract reviewers, and make it take longer.
